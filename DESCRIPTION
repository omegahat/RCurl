Author: Duncan Temple Lang

Description: The package allows one to compose general HTTP requests
     and provides convenient functions to fetch URIs, get & post forms,
     etc. and process the results returned by the Web server. 
     This provides a great deal of control over the HTTP/FTP/... connection and the form
     of the request while providing a higher-level interface than is available just
     using R socket connections.  Additionally, the underlying implementation is robust
     and extensive, supporting FTP/FTPS/TFTP (uploads and downloads), 
     SSL/HTTPS, telnet, dict, ldap, and also supports cookies, redirects, authentication, etc.

Limitations: 
       One doesn't yet have full control over the contents of a POST form such as specifying
       files, content type.
       Error handling uses a single global variable at present.
Note:  This will be used generally to communicate with HTTP servers and specifically
       in the SOAP package, HTML forms and for accessing data on Web sites that require
       more state information than simply URL access (e.g. cookies).
Check:  To run R CMD check, one really needs network access. It is an HTTP client!
        This can be problematic as a Web site may be down when you run
        but the real tests are important.
